## Toy chatbot example for job onboarding
- This is an LLM agent example I built for job onboarding. Especially for new hires, using a chatbot agent may make their onboarding process easier and more effficient.  
- Run code lines of  `./onboarding_chatbot/Langchain_onboarding_hk.ipynb`, which will start the chatbot interactive web server.  
- `./onboarding_chatbot/app.py` includes source code behind the agent.  
- `./RAG_data` includes some example onboarding materials.

## Github repo searchbot to find out relevant code examples
- This is an LLM agent example I built for searching relevant information from github repositories you want to search for.  
- Look at `./repo_searchbot/app.py` or `./repo_searchbot/github_repo_search_4.ipynb`, both of which contain the same code.
